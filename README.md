## Summary

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Analytics in Business at Seattle Pacific University. My interests lie at the intersection of data, community development, and youth empowerment, using insights to drive meaningful and sustainable impact. I’m now leaning into the innovation hub and business development sector, where I enjoy exploring how data and technology can support entrepreneurs and youth-led initiatives to grow. Outside academics and work, I love to crochet and create, whether that’s through content creation, building community, or making something beautiful by hand. I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that create lasting change.
